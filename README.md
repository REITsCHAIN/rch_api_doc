# Introduce

REITs Chain is the leading blockchain explorer, search, API and analytics platform for RCH Chain . As a means to provide equitable access to blockchain data, we've developed the REITs Chain Developer APIs to empower developers with direct access to REITs Chain 's block explorer data and services via GET/POST requests. REITs Chain 's APIs are provided as a community service and without warranty, so please use what you need and no more.

{% hint style="info" %}
Source attribution via a backlink or a mention that your app is "Powered by REITs Chain APIs" is required except for personal/private usage.
{% endhint %}

## API Endpoints

> Your app may need to show a user's RCH balance , check the transaction history of an address 🔍 or get the latest information about a new token and its price💰 .

For that you may find a suitable endpoint from our wide range of APIs that you can simply query to provide data while you remain fully focused on building your applications.
